# Almost - The Band
This project is a personal website for a cover band in Bend, Oregon. 
I am currently figuring out how to deploy the website to the internet, but it the meantime you can open the project is an IDE, run npm i to install and the necessary dependencies, and run npm run start to view the pages! Make sure you have React and Node.js installed!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
